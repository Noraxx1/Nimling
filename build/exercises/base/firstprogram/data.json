    "explanation": "Welcome to the Nimlings! In this exercise, your task is to complete the code to output 'Hello World!' in the console.
The code provided is incomplete, and your job is to fix it to achieve the desired output.

Note: The 'echo' function in Nim is used to print text to the console.
Note: Although Nim doesn't strictly require a 'main' procedure, we've included one here for clarity and ease of understanding. When we call 'main()', we execute the procedures defined within it.",
  
    "hint": "To proceed, modify the 'main' procedure to print 'Hello World!' to the console using the 'echo' command.",
    "desired_output": "Hello World!"
