    "explanation": "Floats are a special tipe of numeric variables that can hold decimal numbers
we already used floats in different exercises such as `datatypes1`.
You can use them exactly like a `int` type variable whit the only difference is to be able to use decimals.

Note: floats take up *8 the memory of a int! So you should use them only when needed.
Note: you can declare a float by adding a deciman number to it eg. `3.0`",
