    "explanation": "In coding somethime whe will need to unificate a float to an integrer and a integrer to a float
this is also needed since you cant sum a float and a int,this is done by using the `float()` and `int()` procedure",

    "hint" : "F should be a float but is an integrer instead, and also it should be $x."
