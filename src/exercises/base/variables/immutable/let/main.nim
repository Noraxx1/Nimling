# Is reccomended for you to first read the code,then to run the explain command.
# this code should output the radious of a circle whit circumference 10.0 .

let pi = 3.14 # declare cosntant,pi and set it to 3.14
circumference = 10.0

proc main() =

    pi = 3.141

 
    # IGNORE THE LINES DOWN BELOW, DONT TOUCH THEM #
    let radius = circumference / (2 * pi)
    echo "The radius of a circle with circumference ", circumference, " is: ", radius
