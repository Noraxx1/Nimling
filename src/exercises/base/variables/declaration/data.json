    "explanation": "NOTE: In coding, we have different types of variables. 
For example, 'int' for integers and 'string' for text. 

Nim is statically typed, which means you need to declare the type of a variable before using it. Here's how you can define variables: 

NOTE: whe can also define multiple variables by typing `var` followed by a indentation and then multiples variables 
NOTE: The dollar symbol ($) transforms an integer to a string, making it possible to print a string followed by an integer with an `echo`, or else we would get a type mismatch. 
NOTE: The ampersand (&) symbol is used to use multiple arguments in a function. We use it to print multiple texts in an `echo` function. 
   

var <name>: <type>  # If you only want to declare the variable without initializing it. But remember, you must assign a value to it later, or you'll get an error! 
var <name>: <type> = <value>  # Use this if you want to declare a variable with a specific type and already know its value. 
var <name> = <value>  # Nim also offers automatic type detection if you just want to assign a value without specifying the type. ",
