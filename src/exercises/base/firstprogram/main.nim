# NOT DONE


# If you dont know whats going on just type 'explain' or type 'hint' if you need some more help!
# in this first exercise your job is to make the code output a 'Hello World!' in the console

# NOTE: When you are ready to run the code type `run` in the nimlings console

# NOTE : using the explanation command doesnt mean youre getting helped,it is just a explanation,while hint is a real help on how you should do the code.
# NOTE : all lines that start whit a `#' are comments and they are basically invisible to the compiler.
